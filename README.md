# Canada-Rent-Regression
In this project, I will work with a [dataset](https://github.com/serapumut/Canada-Rent-Regression/blob/main/Data/canada_rent.csv) containing rental prices for units in across Canada in 2024.  

Dataset obtained from [rentfaster.ca](https://www.rentfaster.ca/?utm_source=OOH&utm_medium=sign&utm_campaign=ca).  

The data dictionary can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergiygavrylov/25000-canadian-rental-housing-market-june-2024).  

My goal is to explore multiple regression models, in order to find a model that predicts the rental price most accurately.  

Iâ€™m starting to project by loading packages and dataset.  

After finding and cleaning missing values, I checked each columns' unique values. In this way, I got clean and useable data by dropping some columns.  

I used visualization to identify the patterns.  

I did Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression respectively.  

Then I did Cross Validation.  

According to Cross Validation results, The MAE, MSE, and RMSE from the test set are slightly higher than the values from cross-validation, which is expected as the model is now being evaluated on unseen data. This indicates that the model is generalizing fairly well.  

As a conclusion, ridge regression model performs reasonably well with the current parameters. The results are consistent, showing that the model can predict rental prices with an acceptable level of accuracy.
